# TODO

- Matrix library
- Generic datastructures library (stacks, queues, LL, tree)
- Compiler
- Pool allocactor
- Game engine?????
- Neural network
  - Talk to the RNN, if asking for image recognition call the CNN to do image recognition
  - If asked for some other pattern recognition task call the MLP
- BMP photo editor?
- Map library (Finish LL first) - Map contains a vector of LL (first node directly embedded to avoid pointer dereference) allowing traversal
- Make a malloc?


Goals in order:

- Finish hashmap for compiler
- Finish datastructures for compiler
- Finish I/O in C++ for MLP
- Finish MLP
- Tokeniser
- Arbitrary precision library in C
- Parser
- IR generator
- Assembler
- Organise all libraries into one repo
- Check for malloc multiplication overflow in all libraries
- Resizing hash table
