# TODO

- Matrix library
- Generic datastructures library (stacks, queues, LL, tree)
- Compiler
- Game engine?????
- Neural network
  - Talk to the RNN, if asking for image recognition call the CNN to do image recognition
  - If asked for some other pattern recognition task call the MLP
- BMP photo editor?
- Map library (Finish LL first) - Map contains a vector of LL (first node directly embedded to avoid pointer dereference) allowing traversal
